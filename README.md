# Solo-pong

## Description
The aim of the game is to make sure the ball hits all the blocks in the screen.

The ball has to bounce against the bar and avoid going below the playing area, otherwise, the game is over and we have to restart the game. 

This game will have three elements; a **ball** , a **bar** and the **blocks**.

Every time the ball hits a block we gain a point.

At the beginning of the game, the ball will be slow, but as the game progress the ball will speed up and the player will have to be faster.

There are going to be three levels of difficulty. The levels are going to be determined by the amount of points the user gets.

1. Beginner

   Points to get: 15 points

2. Intermediate

   Points to get: 30 points

3. Expert

   Points to get: 48 points
