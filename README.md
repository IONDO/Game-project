# Solo-pong

## Description
The aim of the game is to make sure the ball always hits the bar, otherwise, the game is over and we have to restart the game. 

This game will have two elements; a **ball** and a **bar**.

Every time the ball hits the bar we gain a point.

At the beginning of the game, the ball will be slow, but as the game progress the ball will speed up and the player will have to be faster.

There are going to be three levels of difficulty. The levels are going to be determined by the amount of points the user gets.

1. Beginner

   Points to get: 50 points

2. Intermediate

   Points to get: 150 points

3. Expert

   Points to get: 300 points

Every time the user reaches and accomplish a level, a winner screen will appear. However, if he loses, a game over screen will appear.
